# Changelog

## 2.0.0-safari (this fork)

### Added
- **Safari (macOS) support** - the extension now runs as a native Safari Web Extension, packaged via Xcode
- **Click-to-copy banner on Safari** - shortcut and context-menu generation show the alias in a copy banner instead of typing it into the focused field, keeping password managers like Bitwarden in charge of the save-credentials flow
- **Preact + lazy-loaded popup pages** - initial popup bundle dropped from ~412 kB to ~152 kB; Settings/About/Changelog/MyAccount load on demand

### Fixed (Safari-specific)
- Permission requests no longer silently denied (gesture now preserved through the dialog)
- Content-script message handler no longer reloads the host page when the service worker idles

See the [shmublu/Qwacky safari branch](https://github.com/shmublu/Qwacky/tree/safari) for full diff.
